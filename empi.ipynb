But learning about parallel computing is more of learning about a way to *think*. Too often, the subject gets bogged down in details about the particular syntax of a message-passing system. Or you have to deal with hardware difficulties. It's also really hard to debug parallel computers in general. This makes learning interactively much more difficult. \n","\n","But it is possible to learn how to think about parallelism without the particular details of actually making it work. Instead, we can think about what a general computer would know about a parallel problem and what it can do about it. In general, this means the following:\n","\n","* Individual processors require some kind of identifying address. \n","\n","\n","* Data is stored on each process locally without reference to data on other processors. \n","\n","\n","* Data needs to be transferable between processors without interfering with current local data. \n","\n","\n","* Therefore, local processors require at least two (maybe three) different kinds of memory. \n","\n","    - Obviously, the first is a place to store local data. \n","    - Second, we need a *buffer* that can receive messages from other processors. \n","    - In general, buffer sizes need to be large enough to handle messages coming from all relevant processors.\n","    - Possibly third, we might need some temporary workspace to compute intermediate calculations depending if we need to keep old data or not.\n","   \n","   \n","Working in parallel requires breaking a problem up into manageable chunks, distributing the relevant information to different independent processors, sending a command to all the processors, and having them compute the desired result after figuring out what to do between themselves.\n","\n","For example, with a matrix, it is a good idea to put different matrix blocks on different processor cores. But in a parallel computer, the different cores would know nothing of the other core's data without communicating. \n","\n","The problem in Python is that it's hard to hide the data in different data structures but not hide it from the user. \n","\n","## Faux-`Local` arrays\n","\n","On a parallel computer, if you simply ask for data contained on another core, you will either get an error message or, worse, you will get no warning but a bad error nonetheless. \n","\n","To simulate the idea that you can't interact with non-local data, I've made a derived data type. It acts like `numpy` arrays or scalar variables. But the data type \"knows\" what processor it's contained in. It will complain if it tries an operation with another processor.
